# Contributing

## Quick Start
- Please read our [short and sweet coding guidelines](coding_guidelines.md).
- For big changes such as adding new feature or refactoring, [file an issue first](https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim/issues).
- Use our [recommended development workflow](dev_workflow.md) to make changes and test it.
- Use [usual steps](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/) to make contributions just like other GitHub projects. Please use rebase and squash merge, for more information see [An introduction to Git merge and rebase: what they are, and how to use them](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/an-introduction-to-git-merge-and-rebase-what-they-are-and-how-to-use-them-131b863785f/).

## Checklist
- Use same style and formatting as rest of code even if it's not your preferred one.
- Change any documentation that goes with code changes.
- Do not include OS specific header files or new 3rd party dependencies.
- Keep your pull request small, ideally under 10 files.
- Make sure you don't include large binary files.
- When adding new includes, make dependency is absolutely necessary.
- Rebase your branch frequently with master (once every 2-3 days is ideal).
